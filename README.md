#ScannerInCpp
I implement a scanner using inheritance in C++ for the language defined in Appendix A of the dragon book, Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D. Ullman, Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools, Second Edition,
Addison-Wesley, 2007, second edition.

##How to compile & run this program
This program is written in Linux, Gnu make, and GCC(Gnu compiler collention.)
Just type the commands (in BASH shell),
```
make help
```

or

```
make clean all
```
It will compile all the files/codes, then create the execution file.
Then type,
```
./EXENAME
```

In the end, it will work successfully.
